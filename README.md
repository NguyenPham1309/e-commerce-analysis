## 1. Introduction & Objectives

* This project presents how to handle datawarehouse structures using SQL (BigQuery), how to explore the data through EDA process with Python (Google Colab), and how to do the data visualization (Looker Studio) 
* The primary objective is to handle a database from scratch, as a requirement from a client for a consultant to newly come to an e-commerce business. The project will be built on three different phases:
    * First, I need to build a datawarehouse structure that can serve a more long-term analysis in the future (self-service)
    * Second, I need to explore the data thoroughly, using distribution analysis, statistical analysis and correlation among the variables
    * Third, I need to support the decision-making process of the business by enhancing how the company can retrieve the actionable insights by analyzing the visualization.
* This builds upon experience in understanding how to plan analytical layers, build data warehousing (analysis-ready structure), and visualization at my latest company, AIA Vietnam, and other studies throughout my education and personal projects.

## 2. Data Modeling
This dataset is decently structured and standardized, but there are rooms for further exploration to have the analysis efficient

	AND product_code IN ('P002378','P000194','P000157')
ORDER BY product_code, quantity DESC
--The most efficient way to filter a date range 
--is to avoid running functions on the column in the WHERE clause. 
--This allows the database to use an index on the order_date column if one exists. 
--The best practice is to define a date range.
```
* **Test case 1.2 - Product with price movement through time**
```sql

--This implies that the company's pricing or accounting strategy does not allow for simple break-even sales.
